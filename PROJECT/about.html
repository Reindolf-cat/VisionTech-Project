    <h1>Institute History</h1>
    <p>VisionTech Institute was founded in 2018 by a group of passionate educators and IT professionals who saw a growing need for practical, career-focused technology training in the region. Led by Mr. Samuel Owusu, a veteran in ICT education, the institute began with a single classroom, a few computers, and a bold vision: to empower youth and professionals with the digital skills needed to succeed in a fast-changing world.</p>
<p>In our first year, we launched with just 20 students, offering short courses in basic computing, Microsoft Office, and internet literacy. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and by 2020, we expanded to include programs in graphic design, web development, and hardware engineering.
Despite challenges brought by the global pandemic in 2020, VisionTech adapted quickly — introducing online learning and blended classes, making tech education more accessible than ever before.</p>
<p>By 2022, we had trained over 1,000 students, built partnerships with local businesses for internships, and added new tracks in cybersecurity, networking, and mobile app development. We also held our first graduation ceremony, celebrating students who had gone on to launch startups, gain employment, or continue advanced studies.</p>
<p>Today, VisionTech Institute stands as a respected name in practical ICT education. With modern labs, certified instructors, and an ever-evolving curriculum, we continue to bridge the gap between learning and industry — one student at a time.</p>
